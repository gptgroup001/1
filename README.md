# Calculator CLI

This repository contains a simple command-line calculator. Run it with:

```bash
python calculator.py OPERATION A B
```

Where `OPERATION` is one of `add`, `sub`, `mul` or `div`. `A` and `B` are
the two numbers to operate on.

Example:

```bash
python calculator.py add 1 2
```

will print `3.0`.
